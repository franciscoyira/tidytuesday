Visualisation of IMDB data about Doctor Who episodes, showing the number of episodes and distribution of ratings by director. This plot uses custom `ggplot` themes and fonts to match Doctor Who's TV show aesthetic. The data for this specific contribution was made available through the package [`datardis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datardis/index.html).
